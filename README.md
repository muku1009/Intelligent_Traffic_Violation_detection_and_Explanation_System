# üö¶ Intelligent Traffic Violation Detection System

## üìú Project Overview
The **Intelligent Traffic Violation Detection System** is an AI-powered solution designed to enhance road safety by automatically identifying and reporting traffic violations.  
By leveraging **computer vision** and **deep learning techniques**, this system detects violations such as red-light jumping, helmet non-usage, and lane violations, along with recognizing license plates for offender identification.

This system supports large-scale datasets and is designed for real-time scalability, enabling integration with smart city traffic monitoring.
